# I can generate a full modern HTML UI:
# card layout
# score meter (circular gauge)
# expandable matches
# side-by-side comparison window
# downloadable PDF report
# This transforms your tool into something judges will freak out over.
# If you want that, tell me:
# Do you want a clean UI or a Turnitin-style UI?
