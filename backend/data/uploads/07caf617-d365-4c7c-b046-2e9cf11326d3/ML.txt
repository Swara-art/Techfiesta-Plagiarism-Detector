Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on building systems that learn from data.
It allows computers to improve performance without being explicitly programmed.

In supervised learning, models are trained using labeled datasets so they can learn the correct outputs.
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns and structures in data that does not have labels.
